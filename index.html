            Built to become a legend: the Mercedes-AMG ONE. The most
            extraordinary, contemporary, road-legal racing car to emerge from
            Affalterbach. Inspired by Formula 1, peppered with superlatives,
            made for the road.

            <h2>An experience at the limit</h2>
            <p>
              Incredible performance, brought directly to the road. The
              Mercedes-AMG ONE is sports driving in its purest form. With an
              acceleration of 0-200 km/h in 7.0 seconds or 0-300 km/h in 15.6
              seconds, this hypercar sets the direction: the electronically
              regulated maximum speed of 352 km/h. Breathtaking figures that are
              made even more powerful thanks to driver programmes for the
              racetrack drawn from Formula 1. In the Strat 2 programme, the
              active aerodynamics, the tighter chassis tuning, the lowering of
              the vehicle and the full performance of all its motors all operate
              just as in the Formula 1 qualifying. There’s never been anything
              like it. But now it will always be there.

            <h2>Performance from another planet</h2>
            <p>
              The dream of bringing Formula 1 technology directly to the road
              has come true. With this premium-class E PERFORMANCE plug-in
              hybrid, a 1.6-litre V6 turbo petrol engine and four electric
              motors for the turbocharger, crankshaft and front axle act
              together to deliver an impressive 1063 hp system performance.
              Combined with the powerful, directly cooled 800-volt battery
              developed exclusively by High Performance Powertrains, the
              Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 engine builder, the foundation is laid
              for exceptionally agile, high-precision, intensive driving at the
              limit. On the track. And the road.

            <h2>Performance drawn from power</h2>
            <p>
              From unbridled power come formidable driving experiences – thanks
              to the super-strong, lightweight Formula 1 carbon monocoque
              construction in which the powerful engine and exceptional gearbox
              are directly integrated and that provides the exact basis for the
              chassis. The newly-developed, automated 7-speed manual
              transmission with its 4-disc carbon racing clutch is perfectly
              matched to this high-performance Formula 1 hybrid – and can
              perfectly translate the maximum speed of the combustion engine of
              11,000 rpm in order to always draw maximum power. Additionally,
              the sporty, innovative multi-link aluminium chassis with
              transverse push-rod suspension struts highlights the no-compromise
              design of the ONE. The arrangement of this unit makes an anti-roll
              bar obsolete and effectively reduces rolling movements, even
              during very fast changes of direction. A unique composition of
              technology that enables whatever the race track and the street
              allow.

            <h2>Unmistakably exceptional</h2>
            <p>
              An experience like on the home straights at Silverstone or in the
              hairpin by the Grand Hotel in Monte Carlo – the unique sound of
              the Mercedes-AMG ONE delivers a true race feeling. Wherever this
              hypercar is actually showing its prowess, one can already hear
              beforehand that true Formula 1 technology is approaching.
              Goosebumps guaranteed. For driver, pedestrians and fans.
